# Music Platform MVP: Ecash Micropayments Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a regulatory-compliant approach for a music streaming platform to facilitate Bitcoin-backed ecash micropayments ($0.01 per track) between listeners and musicians while avoiding money transmitter licensing requirements.

**Key Strategy**: Platform operates as "Agent of Payee" + Technology Layer, partnering with compliant mint operators rather than running our own mint.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Primary Approach: Agent of Payee Exemption

- **Legal Structure**: Platform acts as musician's authorized agent to collect payments
- **Benefit**: Avoids money transmitter licensing in ~25 states with explicit exemptions
- **Requirements**:
  - Formal written agreements with musicians appointing platform as agent
  - Payment to platform legally satisfies listener's obligation to musician
  - Platform facilitates payment for "goods or services" (music content)

### Secondary Approach: Technology Layer + FBO Accounts

- **Structure**: Partner with banks offering "For Benefit Of" accounts
- **Benefit**: Bank owns/controls funds, platform only provides payment instructions
- **Compliance**: Bank handles all regulatory requirements, platform avoids direct money transmission

---

## Ecash Mint Operations

### Option 1: Bank-Operated Mint (Recommended)
- **Operator**: Partner bank (leveraging recent OCC crypto custody guidance)
- **Structure**: Bank converts FBO account deposits to Bitcoin and issues ecash tokens
- **Benefits**: 
  - Full regulatory compliance
  - FDIC insurance for underlying reserves
  - Established compliance frameworks

### Option 2: Federated Community Mints
- **Operators**: Music industry cooperatives, artist collectives, or community federations
- **Structure**: 3-of-5 or 5-of-7 multisig between trusted guardians
- **Benefits**:
  - Distributed trust model
  - Community ownership
  - Artist participation as guardians

### Option 3: Third-Party Mint Services
- **Operators**: Existing Lightning/ecash service providers
- **Structure**: Platform integrates with established public mints
- **Benefits**:
  - Quick implementation
  - Multiple mint options for users
  - No operational overhead

## Payment Flow Architecture

### Technical Flow
```
1. Listener deposits USD → FBO Account → Bank converts to Bitcoin → Ecash tokens issued
2. Listener sends $0.01 ecash → "To Musician via Platform"
3. Platform receives ecash as musician's authorized agent
4. Platform automatically deducts service fee (e.g., $0.001)
5. Platform forwards net amount ($0.009) to musician's wallet
6. Musician can redeem ecash for Bitcoin or hold for future transactions
```

### Integration Points
- **Wallet Interface**: Non-custodial wallet connections (users control private keys)
- **Mint API**: Connect to partner bank's mint or federated mint network
- **Agent Contracts**: Automated smart contracts for fee deduction and forwarding

## Revenue Model

### Commission Structure

**Phase 1: Single-Sided (Musicians Only)**
- Musicians: 10-15% commission on received payments
- Listeners: Pay face value only ($0.01 per track)
- Platform collects fee from musician's received amount

**Phase 2: Two-Sided (Scale Model)**
- Musicians: 5-10% commission  
- Listeners: 1-2% convenience fee
- Total platform revenue: 6-12% of transaction volume

**Phase 3: Hybrid Premium**
- Basic transactions: Lower commission rates
- Premium features: Subscription tiers
- Analytics/promotion: Additional service fees

### Revenue Examples
- **Daily Volume**: 10,000 tracks × $0.01 = $100 gross
- **Platform Revenue**: $100 × 10% = $10/day
- **Monthly**: ~$300
- **Annual**: ~$3,650
- **Scale Potential**: 1M daily transactions = $36.5K annual

## Technical Implementation

### MVP Architecture

**Backend Services**
- Agent fee calculation and deduction engine
- Multi-mint integration APIs (Cashu/Fedimint protocols)
- Wallet connection management (WalletConnect standard)
- Bank API integration for FBO account management

**Frontend Components**
- Non-custodial wallet interface
- Mint selection/management UI
- Transaction history and analytics
- Artist payment dashboard

**Smart Contract Logic**
```javascript
// Simplified fee deduction flow
function processPayment(amount, artistId, platformFeeRate) {
  const platformFee = amount * platformFeeRate;
  const artistAmount = amount - platformFee;
  
  return {
    platformFee: platformFee,
    artistPayment: artistAmount,
    artistId: artistId
  };
}
```

## Compliance Considerations

### State-by-State Strategy
- **Start in agent of payee friendly states**: CA, NY, TX, IL, OH
- **Use FBO model for remaining states** until broader exemption adoption
- **Monitor regulatory changes** and expand as exemptions become available

### Risk Mitigation
- **Legal counsel specializing in payment law**
- **Regular compliance audits**
- **Clear segregation of roles** (technology vs. financial services)
- **Documented agent relationships** with all musicians
